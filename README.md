## Summary
ImageIQ enables users/companies to bulk upload images to our server. Our web application analyses all the images and classifies them into good,moderate or poor quality images. If the image is good then the appilcation automatically OCR's the image. The classification process helps save time by not further processing the bad and moderate images. <br>
The application uses a Convolution Neural Network to classify the images. Initially we recieved a dataset of 70 images. These images were augmented to increase the effective size of the dataset.
** The CNN Model is not uploaded to Github as it is larger than 100mb in size.**
